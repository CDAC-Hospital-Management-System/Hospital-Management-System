# Hospital-Management-System
Repository for CDAC Project Hospital Management System 


The Hospital Management System aims to solve the traditional issues of hospital management. The existing system provided a paper based solution for keeping OPD records of patients and hospital staff, but it gave overload to Doctor, Receptionist, Admin and Accountant. The main issues were inappropriate data keeping, time wastage in storage, retrieval also patients were unable to understand the prescription etc. These issues are solved by providing a separate user account for doctors and other staff as well as patient. Keeping each patient's data separate and tracking previous visits in a single click. The System Also Sends Email Notification to Patient whenever Payment Status changes to Success and when given Prescription by Doctor. This project uses MYSQL as Database, REACT as Frontend and is developed in Java so it provides features such as platform independence, high performance. It is a web application powered by Spring Security for Authentication and Authorization.

It provides some enhanced features such as: an easy interface to add, remove employees as well as direct mail of prescription to patient. Thus, reducing need to manually write and sign by doctor.
